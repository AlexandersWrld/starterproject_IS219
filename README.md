# IS219 - Data Vizualisation Project

### Topic: ### 
The Link Between Education and Career Success

### Essential Question: ###
How do the choices made in one's academic journey impact their career outcomes? 

### Background: ###
In the age of information, the professional landscape has seen much change in the way skills and knowledge are passed on. In many fields, especially those centered around technology, education is no longer the only ticket in to the professional world. There are many who believe academia to be optional for entry. In my project, I seek to take an objective look at the data and come to a conclusion on whether or not school is the be-all, end-all for career sucess.

### Data Sources: ###
- Kaggle Datasets (CSV)

### Potential Visualizations ###
- Comparative Bar Charts
- Histograms
- Scatter Plots
- Possibly Pie Charts
